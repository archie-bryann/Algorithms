# A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfied the heap property: if B is a child node of A,
# then key(A) â‰¥ key(B). This is a max heap. A min heap works in reverse.

# A priority queue is a special type of queue in which each element is associated with a priority value. And,
# elements are served on the basis of their priority. That is, higher priority elements are served first. However,
# if elements with the same priority occur, they are served according to their order in the queue.

# A heap is an implementation of priority queue. It's a binary tree. Runtime is O(log n) unlike sorting.
